This is the sixth release of the Iedera software : this command line
tool allows to design and select subset seeds according to Bernoulli,
Markov or any HMM model

Version 1.00
============
- Fork of the Hedera program, but without any nucleotide seed
- Vectorized subset seed model proposed
- Hopcroft algorithm has been modified : the old version was in fact
not really carefully programmed and thus worked in more than n.log(n)

Version 1.01
============
- new subset seed automaton implementation used (CIAA07 algorithm).
- possibility to index sequence on "one in cycle'" positions : phase
for multiple seeds is optimized. This is the "-c" parameter
- hill climbing heuristic (-k command)
- keep (minimized) automata of seeds that remain unchanged (faster)
- homogeneous model added [Not Command Lined yet]
- input/output of automata added [Not Command Lined yet]
- bug solved in the PARSEMATRIX column count
- pareto set file input/output (to merge previously computed results)
- bug solved on complete enumeration (memory leak)

Version 1.02
============
- "homogeneous model" modified and command-lined
- add "-transitive" and "-spaced" command-line parameters to provide 
  "nucleic seeds"
- add "-BSymbols"

Version 1.03
============
- "-mx" exclude pattern parameter added
- "-MF" and "-MS" files parameters ... (command line limits)
- Lossless seeds added (work in progress)
- Cycle algorithm modified (now phase is always fixed ... it is a more
  usefull case) with (for each seed) independent cycles and number of
  seeds inside the cycle
- Cycle algorithm command lined for the "-m" option
- Homogeneous algorithm and parameters modified (no max score, now the
  score of full length alignment must be >= than any subpart of it)

Version 1.04
============
- "-fF" option added to input the probabilistic automaton used to
estimate the sensitivity. This parameter can also be used in lossless
mode :
  -> In lossless mode, if some final states are present in this
     automaton, they  are considered as "matching" ones independently
     of the seed chosen, thus  "increasing" in some way the language
     recognized by the seed ... they can thus be considered as reject
     states since they are alway matching (note that the lossless
     algorithm only focus on non final states)
  -> In lossy mode, final states are excluded from the language being 
     recognized
- Bug on the hillclimbing process solved
- Seed positions are now also optimized in the hillclimbing heuristic
- Symetric spaced seeds option added (not in very efficient way,
  usefull anyway)


Version 1.05
============
- Seed positions optimized without "self-coverage" between positions 
- multihit "-y" parameter added : it computes the multihit criterion,
  with overlap between seeds. (Hopcroft minimization now accepts
  differently labelled final set of states)


Version 1.05b
-------------
- Bug on positioned seeds has been solved (not all the positions were
  considered)
- Improvement on positioned seeds (during hillclimbing)


Version 1.06
============
- Automata "Lists" have been replaced by "Vectors" (backlist if need)
- Matrices are now used to compute sensitivity (Sparce "row" implem.)
- Sliced matrix sensitivity computation has been implemented, together
  with the naive algorithm, the "-ll" param. uses this implementation
  to compute "minimal" sensitivity / lossless property of sub-models
- Doxygen documentation improved [work in progress]
- Matrix rows have now a sparse/dense automatic choice : better for
  sliced matrix sensitivity computation
- LDFLAGS replaced by LIBS in autotools : (gcc 4.5/4.6)
- Bug on "Automaton_SeedScore" and "Automaton_SeedScoreCost" has been
  solved
- "-mx" has been extended to cycles, and a new "-mxy" multihit
  criterion has been added to it
- Non Sliced version modified to keep a vector
- Bug on "Transpose" final row flag (index out of bound) solved
- Bug on "Main" number of -ll windows computer (both Slicer/NonSlicer)
- Added (toghether with the -ll option) an option -llf to choose the 
  function that is used to merge sensitivity of all the sub-windows
- Adding hill-climbimg seed edit function on local search optimisation
- Verbose mode "-v" added with different levels
- Coverage sensitivity computation has been implemented, as in
  "Donald Martin 13" : the "-g" parameter uses this implementation to
  compute the "coverage sensitivity" : two normalised macros have been
  added to reduce the number of states of this automaton
- Adding the possibility to combine -m with -r 10000 -k : seeds that
  are given as -m input are mod first to start hillclimbing process
- Modifying the hill-climbing process for the swap : starting pos is
  now selected randomly, and not from the beginning (but the full
  enumeration is still kept)
- Adding a transitive function to generate all the multi-hit/coverage 
  classes for a seed or a set of seeds. [Not Command Lined yet, but
  the output can be seen if "dominance" is activated, see below]

- Adding a sampling procedure for single-hit and multihit sensitivity
  in order to design "larger seed families" (Martin Frith)
  [Not Command lined : #define SAMPLING_STRATEGY_MF]
- Adding the possibility to keep previously computed seed products to
  reuse them during hillclimbing/full enumeration (Martin Frith)
  [Not Command lined : #define KEEP_PRODUCT_MF]

- Adding in addition to the "Cost" and "Prob" semi-rings, a "Count"
  semi-ring: counts are done by default on "long long" integers
  (64 bits) so overflow are easy ; there is a possibility to compute
  "infinite"  Integer sequences for  correlation or count with the
  InfInt header from :
      http://cppip.blogspot.fr/2013/05/infint-downloads.html 
  but it is much slower ... so it's disabled by default
  [Not Command lined : #define USEINFINT]

- Adding the Pearson/Spearman correlation computation for coverage or
  multi-hit available for -y and -g (e.g. -g PEARSON or -g SPEARMAN)
  
  Adding a "lcm.cc" program to generate normalization coefficients
  + a "binomial_weight.h" generated by this lcm.cc program and used
  to generate large tables when correlation computation is activated

- Adding a "Dominance" seed selection, as in [Mak & Benson 2009], 
  with an option "-p" to activate it : will input/ouput polynomials
  coefficients on an additional column (format described in the help)

- <ONGOING>
  Possibility to compute the linear subset automaton : this is
  useful for the "Homology" part of the [Morgenstern & all. 2015]
  variance
  [Not Command Lined yet : set "gv_covariance_flag = true;"]

- Missing infint file added to the package
- Missing lcm.cc and binomial_weight.h with the correct name added to the package
- True Polynomial computations have been added but not command lined yet

Version 1.07
============

- A Full Templating of the automaton class has been applied to the program
  (it can handle <double>,<cost<int>>, <polynomial<long int>>,...)
- Polynomial ongoing
