/** @page seeds Seeds
 *  @brief Seeds description and functions
 *  @tableofcontents
 *
 *  @section seed-description Description
 *  This part describes a seed element : each single seed element is represented by a @ref seed : each seed is thus
 *  represented first by a table of integer (@ref seed::_seedMotif_int) of given length (@ref seed::_span).
 *
 *  @see  seed::table()
 *  @see  seed::span()
 *
 *  Each value within this table must be a seed alphabet letter, and as thus, in the range
 *  [0.. @ref gv_seed_alphabet_size - 1].
 *
 *  It is possible to add some constraints on the positions where the seed will be applied (by default, it is applied
 *  a any possible position it fits).
 *  If any, a table of cyclic positions (seed::_seedCyclePos_int) of given length (@ref seed::_seedNbCyclePos) is
 *  allocated and filled. Each value within this table must be in  the range [0.. @ref seed::_seedMaxCyclePos - 1]
 *
 *  @see  seed::cycled()
 *  @see  seed::pos()
 *  @see  seed::nbpos()
 *  @see  seed::maxpos()
 *
 *  @section seed-enumeration Enumeration
 *  Enumerating seeds of given span, weight, signature is the main tool proposed in the @ref seed.
 *  Signature is a fixed set of number, for each non-null seed elements that are needed for the seed.
 *  Note that null seed elements can be added to increase the span without changing the signature validity.
 *
 *  @subsection full-enum Full enumeration
 *
 *  This is the more time consuming enumeration option, as it fully enumerate the seeds of given span
 *  (between @ref gv_minspan and @ref gv_maxspan), weight (between @ref gv_minweight and @ref gv_maxweight) and possible signature
 *  (@ref gv_signature in activated with @ref gv_signature_flag) constraints.
 *  It also enumerate the set of positions where the seed is applied (when cyclic positions seed:_seedCyclePos_int
 *  is set)
 *
 *  @see  seed::next()
 *
 *  @subsection random-enum Random enumeration
 *  This is the least costly, but also the least efficient way of enumeration seeds of given span
 *  (@ref gv_minspan and @ref gv_maxspan), weight (@ref gv_minweight and @ref gv_maxweight) and signature
 *  (@ref gv_signature in activated with @ref gv_signature_flag) constraints.
 *  since it randomly draw some seeds with these constraints.
 *
 *  @see  seed::random()
 *
 *  @subsection hill-climbing-enum Hill-climbing enumeration
 *  This is a classical local search optimization : when activated, it enumerates all the possible swaps of two
 *  elements, all the one "jocker symbol" add/delete events, all the "one position" changes for positioned seeds
 *  within the current seed until one gives a better result : in this case, this seed is set; otherwise if none is
 *  better, the original seed is reset. Several variables are provided to keep track of local modifications of
 *  the seed "jocker" last edit (@ref seed::_edit_operation, seed::_edit_from, seed::_edit_from_symbol), the seed
 *  last swap (@ref seed::_swap_from, seed::_swap_to) and for positioned seeds, the last edited position
 *  (@ref seed::_edit_cycle_pos_index, seed::_edit_cycle_pos_old_value).
